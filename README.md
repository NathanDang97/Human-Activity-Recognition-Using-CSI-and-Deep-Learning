# Human Activity Recognition Using CSI and Deep Learning

## üîç Goal
Classify simple human activities (e.g., walking, standing, sitting, falling) using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) and a deep learning model trained on time-series data.

## üß∞ Tools and Stack
- Hardware (optional for real-world data): ESP32 with CSI support (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32D)
- Dataset (for simulation or model training): WiFi-CSI-HAR Or Stanford HAR WiFi
- Software:
  - Python + PyTorch / TensorFlow
  - Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
  - NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib for preprocessing
  - scikit-learn (optional)
